This quiz was created using HTML/CSS/JavaScript

When the user hits START, they are taken to the first question of the quiz. The timer also begins ticking down.

Every time the user gets an answer correct, the user is then taken to the next question.

Every time the user get an answer incorrect, the user is then taken to the next question but 5 seconds are deducted from the total time.

Once the user has gone through all of the questions, the user is then taken to a page where the final score is displayed.

The final score is determined by how much time was remaining on the timer when the quiz was completed. (-5 on the timer per every incorrect answer)

The user is then able to submit their initials which is saved to localStorage.
